# Approach
We want the saunarization of the occident! Because the OpenSource Sauna strives for the health of body and mind. And that for everyone. Everyone should have inexpensive access to a sauna and visit it regularly. In a group this is especially bonding. Hence the idea to found a sauna club and to construct a suitable sauna for it.

# Objective
The goal is to develop the documents (construction plans, statics, permission documents, costs) for the construction of a sauna and to publish it as an OpensSource project. The size of the sauna is chosen so that it can be used by a group, e.g. a club. Pilot project for this is the construction of the sauna club building of the "Sauna Schwestern+Br√ºder" in Bavaria/Germany. Corresponding experiences of the construction and its documentation shall be published here.

# Solution
For this purpose, model variants, which are divided into different construction methods depending on budget and craftsmanship skills. Thus a solid wood construction method and a wood post and beam construction method are to be offered. Depending on the location, the facade will also be adapted.

# Project outline
The documents will be uploaded as far as available. For outstanding plans corresponding projects are given. The project is structured as follows:

- Plans for approval planning and data sheets
- Shop drawings
- Details for wood and steel
- Statics
- Cost calculation
- Documentation (photos, videos, descriptions)
- Association foundation documents
